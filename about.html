            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello my name is Felipe Fiasco or Kanyi, the name Felipe Fiasco is my stage name since i'm an artist and music producer, i have used it for a long time so it kinda stuck.
                I have studied diploma in ICT, my experience with being a developer comes from working on real life projects, working with other developers in their projects on the backend and working with the databases, coming up with models in django as they work on the frontend. It has helped me improve on my problem solving ability, i'm creative, determined and always ready to learn.
             I'm also an artist, music producer and video editor when im not coding. Music engineering and coding have the same feel for me because they always have a problem that will need you asking questions and finding ways to answer them. I'm currently familiarizing  myself with machine learning and deep learning while also working on my javascript proficiency. </p>
